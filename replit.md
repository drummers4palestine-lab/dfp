# Drummers for Palestine

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that teaches samba rhythms and protest beats in solidarity with Palestine. The application features an interactive drum machine/beatbox player that allows users to learn traditional samba tunes and protest rhythms. Built with React, Express, TypeScript, and designed with a focus on musical activism and social justice.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Keffiyeh-inspired design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom theming
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for rhythm playback and visualization

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Storage**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **Development**: Vite with HMR for development server

### Build System
- **Bundler**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Development**: Hot module replacement and runtime error overlays
- **Production**: Static file serving with Express

## Key Components

### Audio Engine
- Web Audio API-based rhythm player
- Real-time pattern visualization
- Individual instrument volume controls
- Tempo adjustment and pattern looping
- Synthetic drum sound generation for demo purposes

### Pattern System
- Complex rhythm notation using string patterns
- Support for multiple instruments (surdo, repinique, snare, tamborim, agog√¥, shaker)
- Mnemonic support for learning aid
- Pattern referencing and volume adjustments

### Data Models
- **Tunes**: Traditional samba rhythms with multiple patterns
- **Protest Beats**: Simplified rhythms for demonstrations
- **Users**: Basic user management (prepared for future auth)

### UI Components
- **BeatboxPlayer**: Main interactive rhythm player
- **PatternVisualizer**: Real-time step visualization
- **InstrumentToggle**: Individual instrument controls
- **Navigation**: Responsive navigation with protest theming

## Data Flow

1. **Frontend Request**: React components fetch tune/beat data via TanStack Query
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle CRUD operations for tunes and protest beats
3. **Storage Layer**: In-memory storage with database schema ready for PostgreSQL
4. **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API processes patterns and generates audio output
5. **Real-time Updates**: Pattern visualization updates synchronized with audio playback

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives

### Audio & Visualization
- Web Audio API (native browser)
- Custom audio synthesis for drum sounds
- Pattern parsing and visualization system

### Development Tools
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **@replit/vite-plugin-***: Replit-specific development enhancements
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- tsx with file watching for backend
- Database migrations via Drizzle Kit
- Environment-based configuration

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite build to static assets
- Backend: esbuild bundle to single executable
- Static file serving through Express
- PostgreSQL database deployment

### Database Management
- Drizzle schema with type generation
- Migration system for schema changes
- Connection pooling via Neon serverless

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection
- `NODE_ENV` for environment-specific behavior
- Replit-specific development features
