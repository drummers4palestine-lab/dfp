# Drummers for Palestine

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application designed to teach protest rhythms and fusion beats in solidarity with Palestine. It features an interactive drum machine that allows users to learn traditional tunes and protest-themed rhythms. The project aims to blend musical education with activism and social justice, providing a platform for engaging with and creating solidarity-focused music.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design preference: Black and white theme, no random images, only relevant Palestinian solidarity imagery.
Audio preference: Keep existing sound players intact as they are working well.

## System Architecture
The application employs a modern full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend components.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, utilizing a custom Keffiyeh-inspired design system.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom theming.
- **State Management**: React hooks paired with TanStack Query for server state management.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **Audio**: Leverages the Web Audio API for rhythm playback and visual feedback.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Mobile-first design approach with responsive breakpoints, circular beats with glowing animations, 4-beat musical groupings visually separated, and gradient effects for visual appeal. The overall aesthetic is black and white, emphasizing Palestinian solidarity. The application avoids generic imagery, focusing solely on relevant solidarity-themed visuals.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe interactions.
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions.

### Core Features
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API-driven rhythm player with real-time pattern visualization, individual instrument volume controls, tempo adjustment, and looping. Uses authentic drum samples for diverse sounds and supports specific audio file mapping for instruments like agogô and snare.
- **Pattern System**: Supports complex rhythm notation using string patterns for various instruments (surdo, repinique, snare, tamborim, agogô, shaker) with mnemonic aids for learning.
- **Data Models**: Includes "Tunes" (traditional fusion rhythms with multiple patterns) and "Protest Beats" (simplified rhythms for demonstrations). User management is prepared for future authentication features.
- **UI Components**: Key components include the interactive BeatboxPlayer, real-time PatternVisualizer, InstrumentToggle for individual controls, and responsive navigation.
